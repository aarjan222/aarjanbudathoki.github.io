I am an Electronics Engineering undergraduate from Tribhuvan University, IOE Pulchowk Campus, with a strong passion for robotics, autonomous systems, and embedded technology.

I have completed two internshipsâ€”one in Sensor Fusion & Perception(3 months) and another in Electronics Hardware(2 months) for an industrial hydropower company. As a Working Student at the Robotics Club(18 months), IOE Pulchowk Campus, I contributed to ABU Robocon(Robot Contest), gaining hands-on experience in Robot Kinematics, Control Systems, Sensor Fusion, PCB design, and Fabrication.

My minor thesis focused on an Ackermann Steering-based autonomous vehicle for indoor Mapping, Path Planning & Navigation using ROS2, Nav2, and SLAM, while my major thesis involved developing an IoT-based Greenhouse Management System leveraging AWS services and Yocto Linux. 

Academically, I took a Robotics Elective, worked on Robotics project  in Mapping, Navigation and Pick & Place object simulations in Gazebo.
I am particularly passionate about Sensor Fusion and Perception for autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars, constantly seeking to expand my expertise in this domain.
